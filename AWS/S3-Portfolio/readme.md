### Set up an AWS S3 instance

1. Create an IAM user with s3 full access.
2. Login to that IAM User.
3. Now Let's Start Creating S3 bucket. 
4. I named my bucket as `myprofolio-31jan`
5. Keep settings as default and Create the bucket we will change them accordingly.

7. To host our portfolio to public we have to change some settings in S3 bucket.
- Block public access should be off
- We have to make Bucket policy that should be avilabile to open internet.
- We also have to enable Static website hosting.

9. We have to make a bucket policy.
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::myprofolio-31jan/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
